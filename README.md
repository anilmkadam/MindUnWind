Usage

Being a PHP based web Application, we can test-run it using the PHP server on local machine like XAMPP. The default URL for this will be localhost:8000

Dependencies

1. Tensorflow - pip install tensorflow
2. Keras - pip install keras
3. Bootstrap CDNs - https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css 
                    https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js
4. XAMPP - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Test the Application

STEP 1 - 

Download and install XAMPP onto your local machine.
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

STEP 2 -

Start the XAMPP program. When started, XAMPP loads itself into your icon tray. The icon is orange with a white bone-like shape in its center. Single-click the icon to expand the Control Panel. Click on the "Start" button next to "Apache" to start your Apache Web server. When Apache is running, the word "Running" will appear next to it, highlighted in green. Also start "MySQL" if your PHP scripts depend on a MySQL database to run.

STEP 3 - 

Place your PHP files in the "HTDocs" folder located under the "XAMMP" folder on your C: drive. The file path is "C:\xampp\htdocs" for your Web server. Make sure your PHP files are saved as such; they must have the ".php" file extension. Open up any Web browser on your desktop and enter "localhost" into the address box. The browser will open a list of files stored under the "HTDocs" folder on your computer. Click on the link to a PHP file(index.php) and open it to run a script.
